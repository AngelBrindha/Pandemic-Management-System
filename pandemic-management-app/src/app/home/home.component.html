            A pandemic is a disease outbreak that spans several countries and affects a large number of people.
            Pandemics
            are most often caused by viruses, like Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), which can easily spread from
            person to person.

            A new virus, like COVID-19, can emerge from anywhere and quickly spread around the world. It is hard to
            predict when or where the next new pandemic will emerge.
